Moppy_AVR
=========

Port of [Moppy Arduino code](https://github.com/SammyIAm/Moppy/tree/moppy-advanced/Arduino/Moppy) to AVR C for select AVR microcontrollers. Will be compatable with the Moppy Java program in the [Moppy repository](https://github.com/SammyIAm/Moppy/tree/moppy-advanced).

Link to the [Hackaday Projects page](http://hackaday.io/project/3013-Moppy_AVR) for this thing.

Currently, the code compiles to smaller than 2Kb, so with some editing this could be used on an ATtiny2313, which has hardware UART. I do not have an ATtiny2313 to test on, so haven't tried.
